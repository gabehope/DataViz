# Final Project

## Overview

The final project for this course is an opportunity for you to apply the data analytics and visualization techniques you've learned to a real-world problem of your choice. Working in teams of 2-3, you will select a topic and dataset to analyze, focusing on a central thesis or research question. Your goal is to create insightful visualizations and analyses that illuminate your topic and provide valuable insights to readers. 

As in the homeworks, you'll put youselves in the shoes of a researcher or data journalist. You'll submit two separate reports:

1. **An Article**: Aimed at a general audience, explaining the importance of your topic and illuminating it through compelling narratives and visualizations.
2. **A Technical Report**: Intended for a technical audience, detailing your data collection, processing, analysis methods, and the rationale behind your visualization choices.

Additionally, as a first step, you'll submit a proposal outlining the topic you'd like to explore and how you plan to apporach it. This will allow me to give feedback before you start on the assignment proper.


## Logistics
### Timeline
- Tuesday, November 19 11:59pm Submit a proposal with your group
- Monday, December 9 11:59pm Submit your final assignment on Canvas
- Friday, December 13 11:59pm Submit your final reflections and feedback on Canvas

### Groups
This assignment must be completed in groups of 2-3 students. You are free to switch groups from previous assignments if youâ€™d like. The instructor reserves the right to add students to a group as needed.

### Submission

All parts of the assignment should be submitted through Canvas.

## Choosing a Topic

For this project, you are welcome (and encouraged) to revisit topics you looked at in prior assignments or to choose an entirely new area. In either case you should focus on exploring the topic in more depth than in previous assignments. In particular, you should consider a central focus for your assignment in the form of a thesis or research question. This could take a number of different forms depending on the data and your goals. Below are some broad approaches you could consider with some specific examples.

#### Educating the public on an important issue 

It can be difficult for non-experts to appreaciate the importance and nuances of a given topic. Visualization can be powerful tool for educating and persuading the general public. In the class we've discussed visualizations that help illustrate the scope and urgency of issues like climate change, wealth inequality, COVID spread and others. 

For an educational project you could consider creating a series of visualizations that help provide context for a given topic. For inspiration consider the following works that we've discussed in class:

- [Segregation in U.S. Cities](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/segregation-us-cities/)
- [Fires in California](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/climate-environment/north-complex-fire-california-climate-change/?itid=lk_inline_manual_2)
- [Covid Simulator](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/?itid=lk_inline_manual_4)


You could also go a step beyond education on an issue by making a concrete recommendation. If you have a strong belief that we should implement a particular policy for climate change, criminal justice or just what kind of food the Hoc should serve can you support your case using the tools we've seen in class? Consider making visualizations that compare multiple alternatives or analysis that shows better outcomes with your proposal.

#### Answering a research question

We've explored quite a bit of probabalistic modeling in the class. A different approach to a project could be to try to answer a research question and support your answer through analysis and visualization. This could mean predicting the outcome of a future event such as an election or a sporting event using a probabilistic model or it could mean analyzing the relationship between multiple variables. For inspiration consider the following works that we've discussed in class:

- [FiveThirtyEight election model](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/)
- [Machine bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing)

## Proposal

Before diving into the full project, you are required to submit a proposal. The proposal serves to:

- **Clarify your project's direction**: Ensure that your topic, dataset, and research question are well-defined and feasible.
- **Receive feedback**: Allow the instructor to provide guidance on your proposed approach.

Your proposal should be a concise document (1-2 pages) that includes:

1. **Team Information**:
   - Names of all (2-3) team members.
   
2. **Topic Overview**:
   - A brief description of the topic you have chosen.
   - Explanation of the importance and relevance of the topic.

3. **Dataset Description**:
   - Source of the dataset (include a link if available).
   - Summary of the dataset contents, including the number of observations, variables, and any notable features.
   - Justification of why the dataset is appropriate for your topic.

4. **Central Thesis or Research Question**:
   - Clearly state your central thesis or research question. Think about the following questions:
        - What questions are you hoping to answer?
        - What you you hope a reader will take away from your work?

5. **Preliminary Plan for Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Briefly outline the analytical methods and visualization techniques you plan to use.

6. **Expected Challenges**:
   - Identify potential obstacles or limitations you foresee in your project.
   - Propose strategies for addressing these challenges.

After proposals are submitted, I will schedule a short (5-10 mintue) meeting with each team either during class or in office hours.
