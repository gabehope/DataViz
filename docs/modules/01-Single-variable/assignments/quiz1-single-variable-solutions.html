<p>Assume that you are told that each observation represents a class at Harvey Mudd, and the variable <code>C</code> represents the <strong>number of students</strong> who registered for that class during pre-registration. Which of the following distributions would be <em>most appropriate</em> for modeling the distribution of <code>C</code> (the number of students registered):</p>

<li>Exponential distribution</li>
<li>Normal distribution</li>
<li>Poisson distribution</li>

<p>Alternatively, assume that you are told that each observation represents hourly weather measurements at the summit of Mt.

In this case, which of the following distributions would be <em>most appropriate</em> for modeling the distribution of <code>C</code> (temperature):</p>

<section id="answer-7" class="level3">

<p>As with the Poisson model, the optimal mean is simply the sample mean: <strong>26.97</strong>. The optimal standard deviation is the sample standard deviation <strong>7.47</strong> or the square root of the (unadjusted) sample variance.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="q10-rethinking-our-assumptions">Q10: Rethinking our assumptions</h2>
<p>It turns out that this dataset is actually per-game statistics for Lebron James over the last 5 NBA seasons. Column <code>C</code> is the number of points scored in each game. Given this new knowledge, why might we <strong>not</strong> want to use the Poisson distribution you fit above to predict Lebronâ€™s points scored in the first game of the 2024-2025 season?</p>
<ul>
<li>The Poisson distribution models continuous data, not discrete counts.</li>
<li>The true rate parameter may be changing over time.</li>
<li>Maximum likelihood is not a good way to estimate the parameters of a distribution.</li>
<li>Lebron James is retiring and wonâ€™t play this season.</li>
</ul>
<section id="answer-8" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="answer-8">Answer:</h3>
<p>The best answer is <code>B</code>. As players age or get injured the distribution of points scored per game will likely change.</p>
