<p>Our scientists friends are now interested in studying the biomechanics of penguins with exceptionally long flippers.

<p>Now we need to see if this model is better than our normal distribution model. We know that one way to compare two distributions is by the likelihood or equivalently the <strong>log-likelihood</strong>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^N \log p(x_i)\]</span></p>
<p><em>Note that this is typically the natural log (base <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>), sometime denoted <span class="math inline">\(ln(\cdot)\)</span></em></p>
<p>The <code>logpdf</code> method of a <code>scipy.stats</code> distribution will give use the log-probability of each observation. For the <code>sklearn</code> mixture model, the equivalenty function is <code>score_samples</code>. Therefore we can compute the log-likelihood of each model as follows:</p>

<p>So far, weâ€™ve used a mixture model with 2 components, but we could use more. Letâ€™s see what happens to our <strong>log-likelihood</strong> metric as we increase the number of components.</p>
<p>Above we showed how to fit a mixture model and compute the log-likelihood using <code>sklearn</code>. Now train 10 different mixture models, varying the number of components from 1 to 10. Then plot the relationship between the number of components and the log-likelihood.</p>
<p>Should we always use the model with the best log-likelihood? Why or why not?</p>
